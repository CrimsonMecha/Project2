SPECIFICATION

OVERVIEW

A simple roster program that allows the user to add, remove, and edit players from a mapped soccer team roster.
It does not allow for the deletion of a roster, only the creation of a new season/roster.

DETAILS

The program utilizes a class "player" that stores the name, year of birth, category, and registration status for each player.
These player objects are stored in a map PlayerMap that uses the player's name as a key, and the "player"object as the element of the map.
These player maps are called "seasons", and can be created on runtime or through the use of the start_new_season() command.

Additionally, the user will be able to display a player, display their registration status (sorted by classification),
add or delete a player, and export all of the player data to a new file. 


NOTES FOR LATER VERSIONS

seasons could go un-deleted, and be accessible after a new one is made.
