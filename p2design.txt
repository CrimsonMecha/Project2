COMPONENT: class PlayerMap

A map that stores the player data using their name as the key, and the Player object as the element. 
Uses the following methods:

run() : runs the program, and starts a new seasons

A switch statement allows the user to run the different commands, which are listed and explained below:
 
start_new_season() : User inputs a year, and then creates a new PlayerMap to store new players in, and deletes the old season.

add_player() : adds a new player object to the map
	Creates a new Player object using either the default constructor or by reading the data in from the user, 
	one element at a time. Method runs a large if/else if statement on the year of birth to determine the player's 
	classification.

look_up() : user provides a name, and the program searches the map for the key that matches the name.
	If a match is found, that players data is displayed to the user. If not, the user is 
	shown an error message.

edit_player() : User searches a player, and edits it.
		
delete_player() : User is prompted to search for a player by name (key). 
		Deletes the entire searched PlayerMap key and its associated element. 
	
produce_file() : The user selects a category, or selects "all", and the file outputs the
		relevant data to a file. To maintain organization for each case (not using
		a switch statement, using a string of || ) a temp PlayerMap is used. 
	
display_statistics() : prints out, for each category, who has paid their registration or not. 
	
COMPONENT: class Player

Object to be used as the element in the PlayerMap. Contains the Player's name_ (string), yob_(int),
category_(string), and registration_status_(string). The classificiation is based on the player's year of birth, and the
registration status is whether or not the player has paid registration fees. 

Aside from two constructors (one default, one defined), there are only getter methods in Player:
- name() : returns name_;
- yob() : returns yob_;
- category() : returns category_;
- registration_status() : returns registration_status_
